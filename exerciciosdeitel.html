    printf("%d ", 3);
    printf("%d ", 4);

    return 0;
}

2.18 (Comparing Integers) Write a program that reads two integers from the user
then displays the larger number followed by the words “ is larger .” If the numbers
are equal, display the message “ These numbers are equal .” Use only the single-selec-
tion form of the if statement you learned in this chapter.

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    int a = 0, b = 0;
    printf("%s", "Input 2 integers: ");

   scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);

   if(a == b){
   puts("These numbers are equal.");   
   }
   
   if(a > b){
   printf("%d is larger.\n", a);   
   }

   if(a < b){
   printf("%d is larger.\n", b);
   }
    
    return 0;
}

2.19
Write a program that inputs
three different integers from the keyboard, then displays the sum, the average, the
product, the smallest and the largest of these numbers. Use only the single-selection
form of the if statement you learned in this chapter. The screen dialogue should ap-
pear as follows:
Enter three different integers: 13 27 14
Sum is 54
Average is 18
Product is 4914
Smallest is 13
Largest is 27 

int main(void)
{
    int a = 0, b = 0, c = 0;
    int smalest = 0, largest = 0;
    printf("%s", "Enter three different integers: ");
    scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);

    printf("\nThe sum is %d.\n", a + b + c);
    printf("The average is %d.\n", (a + b + c)/3);
    printf("The product is %d.\n", (a * b * c));
    

    smalest = a;
    if(smalest > b)
        smalest = b;    
     
    if(smalest > c)
        smalest = c;
    
    printf("The smalest is %d\n", smalest);

    largest = a;
    if(largest < b)
        largest = b;    
     
    if(largest < c)
        largest = c;
    
    printf("The largest is %d\n", largest);
      
    return 0;
}

2.20 (Circle Area, Diameter and Circumference) For a circle of radius 2, display the
diameter, circumference and area. Use the value 3.14159 for π . Use the following for-
mulas (r is the radius): diameter = 2r, circumference = 2 π r and area = π r 2 . Perform each
of these calculations inside the printf statement(s) and use the conversion specifica-
tion %f . This chapter discussed only integer constants and variables. Chapter 3 will
discuss floating-point numbers—that is, values that can have decimal points.

int main(void)
{
    float pi = 3.14159;
    float circle_radius = 2;
  
    printf("\nDiameter: %.2f\n", (2 * circle_radius));
    printf("Circumference: %.2f\n", 2 * pi * circle_radius);
    printf("Area: %.2f\n", 2 * pi * (circle_radius * circle_radius));
    
    return 0;
}

2.22 (Odd or Even) Write a program that reads an integer and determines and dis-
plays whether it’s odd or even. Use the remainder operator. An even number is a mul-
tiple of two. Any multiple of two leaves a remainder of zero when divided by 2.

int main(void)
{
    int number;
    puts("Insert a number");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    if(number % 2 == 0){
        printf("Number %d is even.\n", number);
        return 0;
    }

    printf("Number %d is odd.\n", number);

    return 0;
}

2.23 (Multiples) Write a program that reads two integers and determines and dis-
plays whether the first is a multiple of the second. Use the remainder operator. 

int main(void)
{
    int number1;
    int number2;
    puts("Insert 2 numbers");
    scanf("%d%d", &number1, &number2);

    if(number1 % number2 == 0){
        printf("Number %d is multiple of %d.\n", number1, number2);
        return 0;
    }
  

    return 0;
}


2.24 Distinguish between the terms fatal error and nonfatal error. Why might you
prefer to experience a fatal error rather than a nonfatal error?
A fatal error that causes the program to terminate immediately without successfully performing its job. Nonfatal errors allow programs to run to completion, often producing incorrect results.

2.25 (Integer Value of a Character) Here’s a peek ahead. In this chapter, you learned
about integers and the type int . C can also represent uppercase letters, lowercase let-
ters and a considerable variety of special symbols. C uses small integers internally to
represent each different character. The set of characters a computer uses together with
the corresponding integer representations for those characters is called that comput-
er’s character set. You can display the integer equivalent of uppercase A , for example,
by executing the statement
printf("%d", 'A');
Write a C program that displays the integer equivalents of some uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, digits and special symbols. At a minimum, determine the integer
equivalents of the following: A B C a b c 0 1 2 $ * + / and the space character.

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    printf("%d\n", 'A');
    printf("%d\n", 'C');
    printf("%d\n", 'a');
    printf("%d\n", '0');
    printf("%d\n", '1');
    printf("%d\n", '2');
    printf("%d\n", '$');
    printf("%d\n", '=');
    printf("%d\n", '/');
    printf("%d\n", ' ');
    return 0;
}

/* 2.26 (Separating Digits in an Integer) Write a program that inputs one five-digit
number, separates the number into its individual digits and displays the digits sepa-
rated from one another by three spaces each. [Hint: Use combinations of integer di-
vision and the remainder operation.] For example, if the user types in 42139, the
program should display
4 2 1 3 9  */



int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    int num = 42139;

    int dig5 = num / 10000;

    int prox4 = num % 10000;
    int dig4 = prox4 / 1000;

    int prox3 = prox4 % 1000;
    int dig3 = prox3 / 100;

    int prox2 = prox3 % 100;
    int dig2 = prox2 / 10;

    int prox1 = prox2 % 10;
    int dig1 = prox1 / 1;

    printf( "%d   %d   %d   %d   %d\n", dig5, dig4, dig3, dig2, dig1);

    return 0;
}

2.27 (Table of Squares and Cubes) Using only the techniques you learned in this
chapter, write a program that calculates the squares and cubes of the numbers from 0
to 10 and uses tabs to display the following table of values:


int main() {

  printf("number\tsquare\tcube\n");
  printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", 0, 0 * 0, 0 * 0 * 0 );
  printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", 1, 1 * 1, 1 * 1 * 1 );
  printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", 2, 2 * 2, 2 * 2 * 2 );
  printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", 3, 3 * 3, 3 * 3 * 3 );
  printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", 4, 4 * 4, 4 * 4 * 4 );
  printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", 5, 5 * 5, 5 * 5 * 5 );
  printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", 6, 6 * 6, 6 * 6 * 6 );
  printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", 7, 7 * 7, 7 * 7 * 7 );
  printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", 8, 8 * 8, 8 * 8 * 8 );
  printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", 9, 9 * 9, 9 * 9 * 9 );
  printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", 10, 10 * 10, 10 * 10 * 10 );

  return 0;
}

(Target Heart-Rate Calculator) While exercising, you can use a heart-rate
monitor to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your doctors
and trainers. According to the American Heart Association (AHA) ( http://bit.ly/
AHATargetHeartRates ), the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats
per minute is 220 minus your age in years. Your target heart rate is 50–85% of your
maximum heart rate. Write a program that prompts for and inputs the user’s age and
calculates and displays the user’s maximum heart rate and the range of the user’s tar-
get heart rate. [These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA; maximum and84
Chapter 2 Intro to C Programming
target heart rates may vary based on the health, fitness and gender of the individual.
Always consult a physician or qualified healthcare professional before beginning or
modifying an exercise program.] 


int main(void)
{
    
    puts("Insert your age: ");
    int age = 0;
    scanf("%d", &age);
    int max_heart_rate = 220 - age;
    printf("Your max heart rate is %d\n", max_heart_rate);
    printf("Your range target heart rate is betweenn %.2f and %.2f.\n", (float)max_heart_rate * 0.5, (float)max_heart_rate * 0.85);

    return 0;
