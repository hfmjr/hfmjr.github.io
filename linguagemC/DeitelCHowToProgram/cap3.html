3.1 Fill-In the blanks in each of the following questions.

a) A procedure for solving a problem in terms of the actions to execute and the 
order in which the actions should execute is called a(n) "algorithm"

b) Specifying the execution order of statements by the computer is called "program control".

c) All programs can be written in terms of three types of control statements: sequence,
selection, and iteration.

d) The "if...else" selection statement is used to execute one action when a condition 
is true and another action when that condition is false.

e) Several statements grouped together in braces ( { and } ) are called a(n) "block or
compound statement".

f) The "while" iteration statement specifies that a statement or group of statements is
to be executed repeatedly while some condition remains true.

g) Iterating a specific number of times is called "definite".

h) When it’s not known in advance how many times a set of statements will be repeated, 
a "sentinel" value can be used to terminate the iteration. 

3.2 Write four different C statements that each add 1 to integer variable x.
x = x + 1;
x += 1;
++x;
x++;

3.3 Write a single C statement to accomplish each of the following:
a) Multiply the variable product by 2 using the *= operator.
b) Multiply the variable product by 2 using the = and * operators.
c) Test whether the value of the variable count is greater than 10. If it is, print
"Count is greater than 10" .
d) Calculate the remainder after quotient is divided by divisor and assign the
result to quotient . Write this statement two different ways.
e) Print the value 123.4567 with two digits of precision. What value is printed?
f) Print the floating-point value 3.14159 with three digits to the right of the
decimal point. What value is printed?

a) product *= 2;
b) product = product * 2;
c) if(count > 10){
   puts("Count is greater than 10");
}
d)quotient = quotient % divisor;
   quotient %= divisor;   
e) printf("Value is %.2f", 123.4567); - printed 123.46
f) printf("Value is %.3f", 3.14159); - printed 3.142

3.4
Write a C statement to accomplish each of the following tasks.
a) Define variable x to be of type int and set it to 1 .
b) Define variable sum to be of type int and set it to 0 .
c) Add variable x to variable sum and assign the result to variable sum .
d) Print "The sum is: " followed by the value of variable sum .

int x = 1;
int sum = 0;
sum += x;
printf("The sum is: %d", sum);

3.5 Combine the statements from Exercise 3.4 into a program that calculates the
sum of the integers from 1 to 10. Use the while statement to loop through the 
calculation and increment statements. The loop should terminate when x becomes 11.

int x = 1;
int sum = 0;
while(x <=10 ){
   sum += x;
   x++;
}
printf("The sum is: %d", sum);

3.6 Write single C statements to perform each of the following tasks:
a) Input integer variable x with scanf . Use the conversion specification %d .
b) Input integer variable y with scanf . Use the conversion specification %d .
c) Set integer variable i to 1 .
d) Set integer variable power to 1 .
e) Multiply integer variable power by x and assign the result to power .
f) Increment variable i by 1 .
g) Test i to see if it’s less than or equal to y in the condition of a while statement.
h) Output integer variable power with printf .

a) scanf("%d", &x);
b) scanf("%d", &y);
c) int i = 1;
d) int power = 1;
e) power *= x;
f) i++;
g) while ( i <= y){}
h)printf("Output of power variable is %d", power);

3.7 Write a C program that uses the statements in the preceding exercise to calculate
x raised to the y power. The program should have a while iteration control statement.
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
      
      puts("Insira o valor de X");
      int x = 0;
      scanf("%d", &x);
      puts("Insira o valor de y");
      int y = 0;
      scanf("%d", &y);
      
      int i = 1, power = 1;
      while (i <= y)
      {
         power *= x;
         i++;
      }

      printf("Valor de power eh %d\n", power);
      return 0;
}

3.8 Identify and correct the errors in each of the following:
a) while (c <= 5) {
   product *= c;
   ++c;
Missing curly brace at end of block while.
   
b) scanf("%.4f", &value);
Format %.4 is for display. Should be just %f

c) if (gender == 1) {
   puts("Woman");
}
else; {
puts("Man");
}

Sintax error, semicolon after else.

3.9 What’s wrong with the following while iteration statement (assume z has value
100), which is supposed to calculate the sum of the integers from 100 down to 1?
while (z >= 0) {
   sum += z;
}
Missing z-- to avoid infinite loop.

Exercises
3.10 Identify and correct the errors in each of the following. [Note: There may be
more than one error in each piece of code.]
a) if (age >= 65); {
   puts("Age is greater than or equal to 65");
}
else {
   puts("Age is less than 65");
}
Semicolon after parenthesis


b) int x = 1;
   int total;
while (x <= 10) {
   total += x;
++x;
}
Total ao não ser inicializado vai conter sujeira.

c)
While (x <= 100)
total += x;
++x;
Faltando abrir e fechar o bloco com as chaves {}
E o C é case sensitive, então não pode W maiúsculo.

d) while(y > 0) {
   printf("%d\n", y);
   ++y;
}

O laço é infinito, pois continuará com y > 0 e o y será incrementado.


3.11 Fill-In the blanks in each of the following:
a) The solution to any problem involves performing a series of actions in a specific "order".

b) A synonym for procedure is "algorithm".

c) A variable that accumulates the sum of several numbers is a(n) "total"

d) A special value used to indicate “end of data entry” is called a(n) "sentinel", a(n) flag
or a(n) dummy value.

e) A(n) "flowchart" is a graphical representation of an algorithm.
f) In a flowchart, the order in which the steps should be performed is indicated by "Flowlines"
symbols.

g) Rectangle symbols correspond to calculations that are normally performed by assignment 
statements and input/output operations that are normally performed by calls to the printf
and scanf Standard Library functions.

h) The item written inside a decision symbol is called a "condition."

3.12 What does the following program print?

#include <stdio.h>
   int main(void) {
   int x = 1;
   int total = 0;
   while (x <= 10) {
      int y = x * x;
      printf("%d\n", y);
      total += y;
      ++x;
   } // end while
   printf("Total is %d\n", total);
} // end main

<p>3.15 State which of the following are true and which are false. If a statement is false,
explain why.</p>

3.16 (Gas Mileage) Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their auto-
mobiles. One driver has kept track of several tankfuls of gasoline by recording miles
driven and gallons used for each tankful. Develop a program that uses scanf to input
the miles driven and gallons used for each tankful. The program should calculate and
display the miles per gallon obtained for each tankful. After processing all input in-
formation, the program should calculate and print the combined miles per gallon ob-
tained for all tankfuls. Here is a sample input/output dialog:
</div>
<div>Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): 12.8
Enter the miles driven: 287
The miles/gallon for this tank was 22.421875
Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): 10.3
Enter the miles driven: 200
The miles/gallon for this tank was 19.417475
Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): 5
Enter the miles driven: 120
The miles/gallon for this tank was 24.000000
Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): -1
The overall average miles/gallon was 21.601423</div>

<div>3.17 (Credit-Limit Calculator) Develop a C program that will determine whether a
   department-store customer has exceeded the credit limit on a charge account. For
   each customer, the following facts are available:
   a) Account number
   b) Balance at the beginning of the month
   c) Total of all items charged by this customer this month
   d) Total of all credits applied to this customer's account this month
   e) Allowed credit limit
   The program should use scanf to input each fact, calculate the new balance (=
   beginning balance + charges – credits), and determine whether the new balance exceeds
   the customer's credit limit. For those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the
   program should display the customer's account number, credit limit, new balance
   and the message “Credit limit exceeded.” Here is a sample input/output dialog:
   Enter account number (-1 to end): 100
   Enter beginning balance: 5394.78
   Enter total charges: 1000.00
   Enter total credits: 500.00
   Enter credit limit: 5500.00
